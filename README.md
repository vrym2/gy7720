# Automatic detection of Storage Oil tanks using Deep Learning models with Satellite data

## Sentinel-1 data
* All the geographic location data of [Oil terminals](https://github.com/vrym2/UK_oil_terminals) in the UK has been collected manually.
* Sentinel-1 data can be downloaded with the modules developed in the [Sentinel-SAR](https://github.com/vrym2/Sentinel_SAR) repository.
* S1-data processing modules can be found in the [Sentinel-1_processing](https://github.com/vrym2/SAR-Processing) repository.

## Planet Labs
* Planet Labs Scenes download functions and modules can be found in [Planet_UoL](https://github.com/vrym2/planet_UoL) repository.

## Cascade R-CNN model training
* Model training with instructions and inference jupyter notebook can be found in [otd_mmdet](https://github.com/vrym2/otd_mmdet) repository.

## YOLOX model implementation
